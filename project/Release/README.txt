EAmpire Tower Defense Game
Disclaimer: This is only a demo and not representative for the final version

There are no enemies and real towers yet. Right now, the game is more like a path-finding simulator. 
You can:
	- Click on the 'Tower' button to go into build mode and obstruct a tile
	- Do the same by pressing the '1' key on your keyboard (not numpad)
	
	- Click on the 'Sell' button to remove an obstructed tile
	- Do the same by pressing the 'Del' (delete) key on your keyboard
	
	- The menu button closes the game
	- You can also close the game by pressing the X in the top right corner
	- You can also close the game by pressing the 'Esc' (escape) key on your keyboard
	
If the game does not show you the way, it means there is no way from the beginning of the grid to the end.
